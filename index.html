            <p>Thinking way too much about my childhood, while writing the previous entry, left an image in my mind that I needed to research, but also a lingering question: If at the beginning I only remember having a single game cartridge (one that combined <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. and <em>Duck Hunt</em>), how did I get to play at home so much of <em>Excitebike</em>, <em>Kung Fu</em>, and many other NES titles? As usual, Reddit had the answer, and everything makes sense now.</p>

            <p>The image I had stuck in my head was that of a blue screen with a long list of titles in white letters; as it turns out, what I remembered was the blue menu screen of a bootleg NES cartridge known as <em>76-in-1</em>, as in 76 pirated games in 1 shady-but-awesome cartridge. Damn.</p>

            <p>I can always admit that piracy had a huge starring role in defining my love for games during the unemployed days of my life. I just didn't know it went <strong>that</strong> far back. But hey, knowing what I know now about software shadiness, I think it's probable that the one proper Mario cartridge we owned might have been a fake as well. Who knows, maybe the console itself was a bootleg!</p>

            <p>A few days ago, Val got some time off from work, and I watched her play through the final stages of <em>Unpacking</em>, including <em>“the one with the childhood room”</em>, to leave it vague. I loved how moving the ending was for us, and how beautifully it captured the idea of moving to a new place together. It also made me wish I had kept at least a couple of my gaming relics, and how wild it would be to see that old NES console again, or that <em>Flintstones</em> game for it that I rented so much my dad ended up buying.</p>

            <p>For now, I have to be content with the ROM of <em>76-in-1</em> I found online, played on an Xbox controller. I had totally forgotten about <em>Battle City</em>, <em>Urban Champion</em>, <em>Mabby</em>... <em>Tennis</em>!</p>
            
            <p>P.S. Damn. They were hard.</p>

            <p><em>Super Mario Bros.</em> being the first thing I ever played is probably a good guess, but it is definitely hard to know for sure, now that I think about it. In my tiny-90s-kid memories of games, there's a lot of jumping and falling to my death in those first two stages of the original World 1, but there are also some fragments of <em>Pac-Man</em>, <em>Circus Charlie</em>, <em>Excitebike</em>, <em>Battle City</em>, <em>Ice Climber</em>... an Atari game titled <em>Keystone Kapers</em>?</p>

            <p>It's impossible to know for sure, really, but in my heart, I believe Mario was the first one. Probably.</p>

            <p>In the kid years that followed, there was a bit more jumping and falling with <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>, <em>Super Mario World</em>, and, of course, the breathtaking magic trick that was <em>Super Mario 64</em>, back in '96. The first two I remember playing mostly in tandem with my sister, at home, and the latter whenever I was given the chance in the N64s of friends and cousins. That was, pretty much, my whole personal history with the Super Mario games, and with the inconveniences of being a child, and all of that falling business, I never got to see the ending of any of them.</p>

            <p>But! The year is 2023, I'm super old now and <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> and its wonderful Wonder Seeds are working on me as the best remedy for a heart that misses his comrades and adventures in <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, still. The game feels fantastic, and I have no doubts that it will become the very first Mario I see through its end credits. At last!</p>

            <p>In a way, Wonder <em><strong>is</strong></em> my first Super Mario game.</p>
            
            <p>Hopefully, the first of many.</p>

            <p>Games spent enough time in my head for the creation of this site to feel almost inevitable. Or maybe it has to do with the year ending?</p>

            <p>In any case, <strong>here it is!</strong> I'm not entirely sure of what the goal for this rambling is, but for now I hope that someday it could be fun to look back at these old thoughts and remember the good, the bad, and the 
                
            <em>Baldur's Gates</em> of it all.</p>
