            <p>The Operation Sports crew are saints and they just saved football for me. Another Christmas miracle!</p>

            <p><em>Bellinghamania</em> is fully underway, and not since <em>Zizou</em> was appointed Madrid's manager in 2016 have I been this excited about the future of the club. I needed <em>something</em> from video games to carry me on this wave, but I was soon confronted with a landscape that couldn't be more horrifying and depressing:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><em>PES</em> is dead, and Master League is still missing in action. RIP.</li>
                <li>eFootball plays well, but the online mode it promotes is awful and boring.</li>
                <li>Football Manager is too dangerous of a drug. I should stay away. <em>Far, far away</em>...</li>
                <li><em><s>FIFA</s> EA FC</em> is... uh... well... the only choice, I guess.</li>
              </ol>

            <p>It's the only modern choice to have some sort of career mode, like old times, since all other options would require patching an old PES to make it more <em>Bellinghamful</em>. Sadly, it also feels terrible to play, with every player flying or skating across the pitch, with perfect first touch and an insanely precise shot accuracy.</p>

            <p>So life was meaningless and full of pain... But then <a href="https://forums.operationsports.com/forums/ea-sports-fifa-sliders/1014656-ea-sports-fc-24-os-community-sliders.html" target="_blank">this heavenly thread</a> changed everything, and now I should leave this entry here so I can go and play <em>just one more game</em>...</p>

            <p>. . .</p>

            <p>P.S. We got our first Christmas tree today, and it was as magical as Jude Bellingham himself:</p>

            <p>Lae'zel, Shadowheart, Astarion, Gale, Wyll, Karlach, Halsin, Jaheira, Minsc... and Boo.</p>

            <p>This is the order in which I met my companion characters in <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, or rather, the order in which I became totally enamored with them, and all through the power that writing and acting has in making a truly magical video game experience.</p>

            <p>After many months and memories with the game and this band of outsiders, I have to say... something about the ending was off. It didn't sour the journey or anything, but the stuff that happened just before the credits rolled felt a bit rushed, like a moment was missing. Saying goodbye was inevitably bittersweet, but in the back of my mind, the word "Epilogue" appeared. I could already imagine a party in the style of <em>Mass Effect 3: Citadel</em>, or maybe something more subtle, like that final walk around town that <em>A Space for the Unbound</em> did earlier in the year.</p>

            <p>Now, imagine my face when I read the notes for Patch 5 yesterday.</p>

            <p>Christmas. Is. Here.</p>

            <p>Thinking way too much about my childhood, while writing the previous entry, left an image in my mind that I needed to research, but also a lingering question: If at the beginning I only remember having a single game cartridge (one that combined <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. and <em>Duck Hunt</em>), how did I get to play at home so much of <em>Excitebike</em>, <em>Kung Fu</em>, and many other NES titles? As usual, Reddit had the answer, and everything makes sense now.</p>

            <p>The image I had stuck in my head was that of a blue screen with a long list of titles in white letters; as it turns out, what I remembered was the blue menu screen of a bootleg NES cartridge known as <em>76-in-1</em>, as in 76 pirated games in 1 shady-but-awesome cartridge. Damn.</p>

            <p>I can always admit that piracy had a huge starring role in defining my love for games during the unemployed days of my life. I just didn't know it went <strong>that</strong> far back. But hey, knowing what I know now about software shadiness, I think it's probable that the one proper Mario cartridge we owned might have been a fake as well. Who knows, maybe the console itself was a bootleg!</p>

            <img style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; max-width: 600px; margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 35px;" src="images/journal/my-nes-games.png" alt="">

            <p>A few days ago, Val got some time off from work, and I watched her play through the final stages of <em>Unpacking</em>, including <em>“the one with the childhood room”</em>, to leave it vague. I loved how moving the ending was for us, and how beautifully it captured the idea of moving to a new place together. It also made me wish I had kept at least a couple of my gaming relics, and how wild it would be to see that old NES console again, or that <em>Flintstones</em> game for it that I rented so much my dad ended up buying.</p>

            <p>For now, I have to be content with the ROM of <em>76-in-1</em> I found online, played on an Xbox controller. I had totally forgotten about <em>Battle City</em>, <em>Urban Champion</em>, <em>Mabby</em>... <em>Tennis</em>!</p>
            
            <p>P.S. Damn. They were hard.</p>

            <h2 class="journal-entry-title">A <em>Mario-Shaped</em> Hole</h2>

            <p><em>Super Mario Bros.</em> being the first thing I ever played is probably a good guess, but it is definitely hard to know for sure, now that I think about it. In my tiny-90s-kid memories of games, there's a lot of jumping and falling to my death in those first two stages of the original World 1, but there are also some fragments of <em>Pac-Man</em>, <em>Circus Charlie</em>, <em>Excitebike</em>, <em>Battle City</em>, <em>Ice Climber</em>... an Atari game titled <em>Keystone Kapers</em>?</p>

            <p>It's impossible to know for sure, really, but in my heart, I believe Mario was the first one. Probably.</p>

            <p>In the kid years that followed, there was a bit more jumping and falling with <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>, <em>Super Mario World</em>, and, of course, the breathtaking magic trick that was <em>Super Mario 64</em>, back in '96. The first two I remember playing mostly in tandem with my sister, at home, and the latter whenever I was given the chance in the N64s of friends and cousins. That was, pretty much, my whole personal history with the Super Mario games, and with the inconveniences of being a child, and all of that falling business, I never got to see the ending of any of them.</p>

            <p>But! The year is 2023, I'm super old now and <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> and its wonderful Wonder Seeds are working on me as the best remedy for a heart that misses his comrades and adventures in <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, still. The game feels fantastic, and I have no doubts that it will become the very first Mario I see through its end credits. At last!</p>

            <p>In a way, Wonder <em><strong>is</strong></em> my first Super Mario game.</p>
            
            <p>Hopefully, the first of many.</p>

            <p>Games spent enough time in my head for the creation of this site to feel almost inevitable. Or maybe it has to do with the year ending?</p>

            <p>In any case, <strong>here it is!</strong> I'm not entirely sure of what the goal for this rambling is, but for now I hope that someday it could be fun to look back at these old thoughts and remember the good, the bad, and the 
                
            <em>Baldur's Gates</em> of it all.</p>
